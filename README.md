# cpp-problems

These are some problems I found online or in coding interviews. Each and every cpp file has its own main and compiled independently. I will be supplementing makefiles that should be used as:

- For an example question that is called ASD

  - A markdown file named **asd.md** that describes the problem.
  - A markdown file named **asd_sol.md** that describes the approach(es) I took for the answer submitted.
  - A file named **asd.cpp**
  - A make command **make asd**

- One single clean command **make clean**
- And an **all** command that defaults to only **make**

You don't or can't use GNU Make? I don't care for now, just compile files, it's not that hard.
