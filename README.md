# cpp-problems

These are some problems I found online or in coding interviews. Each and every cpp file has its own main and compiled independently. I will be supplementing makefiles that should be used as:

- For an example question that is called *ASD*
  - There will be a folder called **asd**
  - A markdown file named **asd.md** that describes the problem.
  - A markdown file named **asd_sol.md** that describes the approach(es) I took for the answer submitted.
  - A file named **asd.cpp**
  - A makefile defaults to making asd.cpp

- One single clean command for all independent solution and all **make clean**
- And an **all** command that makes all the answers (not recommended).

You don't or can't use GNU Make? I don't care for now, just compile files, it's not that hard.
